Designed a Power BI dashboard to uncover seasonal revenue patterns and business momentum using star schema modeling, DAX measures, and multi-dimensional slicing.</i><br>

### Description:
This project focuses on analyzing four years of sales data (2015–2018) to understand how seasons, customers, and suppliers drive revenue. I built a scalable data model in Power BI with the following features:
- Data Transformation: Combined Excel and CSV revenue data, unpivoted structures, and created surrogate keys for customer, supplier, color, and category dimensions.
- Star Schema Design: Developed a fact-dimension model with FactRevenue at the core and supporting tables like DimDate, DimCustomerCategory, DimSupplier, etc.
- Custom DAX Measures: Calculated year-to-date (YTD) revenue, seasonal contributions, and prior year comparisons to track momentum and growth.
- Visual Storytelling: Delivered a business-ready report theme titled “Revenue in Motion”, with seasonal KPI cards, time series charts, customer and supplier segment insights, and slicers for drill-down analysis.

The dashboard revealed that:
- Warm seasons contribute 53% of total revenue.
- Corporate and Gift Stores peak in Spring/Winter.
- 2017 had the fastest early revenue growth.

📅 Timeline: April–May 2025
